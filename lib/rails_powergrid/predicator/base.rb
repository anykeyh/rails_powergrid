# Make easy request on multiple fields without hassle
# (for you, because lot of hassle from my point of view!)
#
# It works with a parser on the javascript side
# Which transform a ActiveRecord-where-string-like clause
# Into a JSON tree
# Then get it back here and transform the tree to
# a ActiveRecord-where/having-string clause.
#
# Yep. FYI, The hassle is about the HAVING clause
# It occurs when we want to filter on a column which is not
# a real column but a aggregated column (like count(*)+group by)
# The was is this:
#
# WHERE a=1 AND (b=2 OR COUNT(*)=3)
#
# Should be translated in
#
# WHERE a=1
# HAVING b=2 OR COUNT(*)=3
#
# (Note the fact the b=2 should be in having, thanks to the OR operator...)
#
# This module is actually coupled with RailsPowergrid
# But I secretly want to make it independant.
# The only problem is - I'm lazy - and the column aggregation tag fields should be
# passed in some way (check the comments below).
# Plus the arel_table for ambiguous columns...
